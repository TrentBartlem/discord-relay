# Discord Relay

Discord Relay is an app that allows subreddit moderators to relay items from their subreddit to a Discord channel. This
is useful for subreddits that want to keep their Discord server up-to-date with the latest content from their subreddit.
This also can be used to relay a specific users' posts and/or comments to Discord.

## Usage

Discord Relay runs when a comment or post is created (after Reddit's safety checks). The only time you need to interact
with it is during the setup process. To set up and configure Discord Relay, navigate to the settings page on your
subreddit:`https://developers.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/apps/discord-relay`.

- **Role Ping settings**: The role to ping when a new item is relayed to Discord.
    - **Ping a role?**: If enabled, ping the role when a new item is relayed.
